title: PentaCode Youtube Channel
description: In 2014, as a young junior web developer, I wanted to share everything I learned to the public because I 'm a deep believer in learn by teaching.  I decided to create this Youtube channel as a way to help me compile everything I know in one place.  I recorded every video in one take and some of them went viral!  Almost 10 years later, I continue to do the same. You can visit a list of tutorials on https://www.penta-code.com/
